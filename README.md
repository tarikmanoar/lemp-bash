# Highload LEMP Installation

This bash script will install LEMP stack on your Ubuntu and configure it to maximize its performance of website serving.

## Features
* All-in-one one "click" installation of the [LEMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) environment
* [Nginx](https://launchpad.net/~hda-me/+archive/ubuntu/nginx-stable) will be installed with the ability to dynamically load or disable any preloaded module
* [Backup](https://gist.github.com/tarikmanoar/717efdfadd8052d456c2e4da16b0163b) will be created for your current Nginx, PHP and MySQL / MariaDB installations
* Some core settings of [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html) and [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/server-system-variables/) that are often underestimated are configured properly
* [OPcache](http://php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php) is enabled and configured for PHP-FPM 
* [Monit](https://mmonit.com/monit/) will be configured to watch after SSH, Nginx, PHP and MySQL / MariaDB and restart them in case of an emergency
* This configuration was tested in heavy loaded environment (>500k requests to a webserver a day) more then six months straight
* Don't struggle anymore with adding new server blocks to Nginx when you add new websites to your server

## Getting started
Every command is well commented so you will know what  happens after each line of the code.

## Requirements
* Ubuntu 16.04 or later (best if it's fresh / clean installation)
* This script utilises **root** user privileges. If you run it from another user you need to add this user to sudoers group and prepend sudo to all commands in the script.

## Usage

To download and run this script in a single command use the line below:
```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tarikmanoar/lemp-bash/master/install.sh && bash install.sh
```
Or download install.sh manually, make it executable and run it:
```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tarikmanoar/lemp-bash/master/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
LEMP will be configured in such a way that it will try to find a folder which is identical to a website name in your /var/www/ directory.
<br/>For example if you created an A-record in your DNS panel where you pointed '@' name of 'test.com' domain to '1.2.3.4' IP adress of your server and you try to access 'test.com' LEMP will try to serve index.php or index.html from the /var/www/test.com directory as an initial response.

**MariaDB password** is generated using md5 hash of your server hostname and will be put in your /etc/mysql/my.cnf after [client] directive. 

## Example Files

These files will be created in order to help you understand how this installation works:
* "Hello World" website in /var/www/test.com 
* phpinfo(); file at /var/www/test.com/info.php
* [opcache.php](https://github.com/rlerdorf/opcache-status) at /var/www/test.com/opcache.php

## Verification

You can verify the installation with the info.php file or using the following commands.
<br/>This will show current Nginx version and all installed Nginx modules:
```shell
nginx -V
```
These will show current PHP-FPM version all installed PHP-FPM modules:
```shell
php -v
php -m
```
These will show current MariaDB version and promt EXIT; command if you entered MariaDB shell:
```shell
mysql -v
EXIT;
```

## Contributing
Please, feel free to fork this repository and add support for your OS. It will greatly help developers who prefer another OS. I' am not doing this myself because I found that using prebuilt packages from Ubuntu repository makes usage of this script endlessly faster with less headache then trying to define why Nginx package is not compiling from the source code on this or that particular OS.
